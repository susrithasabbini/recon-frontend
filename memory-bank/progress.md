### Task: Implement Dynamic Color Theming and Apply to Components

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Implemented a dynamic color theming system allowing users to select a primary color scheme (blue, red, pink, etc.) from a navbar dropdown.
  - Created `src/config/colorThemes.ts` to define theme palettes (primary, focus, content colors).
  - Added CSS custom properties (e.g., `--color-primary-rgb`) to `src/styles/globals.css`, using space-separated RGB values for Tailwind compatibility.
  - Updated `tailwind.config.js` to use these CSS variables for its `primary`, `primary-focus`, and `primary-content` color definitions, and also configured the default `ringColor` to use the theme's primary color.
  - Created `src/contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` with a provider to manage the active theme, apply it by setting CSS variables on the root element, and persist the choice to localStorage. The `hexToRgb` utility was updated to output space-separated values.
  - Developed `src/components/ColorThemeSelector.tsx`, a dropdown component using HeroUI `Select` for theme selection.
  - Integrated `ColorThemeSelector` into `src/components/navbar.tsx`.
  - Wrapped the main application in `src/App.tsx` with `ColorThemeProvider`.
  - Refactored `src/components/row-steps.tsx` to remove its internal color prop logic and instead use the new theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes (`text-primary`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary-content`).
  - Updated the `title` primitive in `src/components/primitives.ts` to add a `primary` color variant (using `text-primary`) and ensured it doesn't conflict with gradient styles.
  - Updated page titles in `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`, and `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` to use `title({ color: "primary" })` so they reflect the selected theme.
  - Applied themed focus ring styles to `Input` and `Select` components across `merchant-creation.tsx`, `account-creation.tsx`, `rules-mapping.tsx`, `file-upload.tsx`, and `file-upload-form.tsx` using the `classNames` prop.
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `src/config/colorThemes.ts` (created)
  - `src/styles/globals.css` (updated)
  - `tailwind.config.js` (updated with ringColor)
  - `src/contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` (created, updated)
  - `src/components/ColorThemeSelector.tsx` (created, updated)
  - `src/components/navbar.tsx` (updated)
  - `src/App.tsx` (updated)
  - `src/components/row-steps.tsx` (updated)
  - `src/components/primitives.ts` (updated)
  - `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx` (updated for title and input focus)
  - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` (updated for title and input/select focus)
  - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` (updated for title and select focus)
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` (updated for title and select focus)
  - `src/components/file-upload-form.tsx` (updated for select focus)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (to be updated)
  - `memory-bank/techContext.md` (to be updated)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Initial import errors for `colorThemes.ts` due to incorrect path assumptions and possibly TS server caching. Resolved by ensuring file creation and using correct alias.
  - `SelectItem` prop issue in `ColorThemeSelector` (removed `value` prop).
  - Buttons appeared transparent after Tailwind config update; resolved by changing CSS variable values and `hexToRgb` output to space-separated RGB values.
  - `title` primitive in `merchant-creation.tsx` (and other pages) caused a TS error when `color: "primary"` was used; resolved by updating the `title` primitive definition in `primitives.ts`.
  - Input focus rings remained blue; initially attempted to fix with `tailwind.config.js` `ringColor` default, then further addressed by applying specific `focus-within:ring-primary` and `focus:ring-primary` classes to `Input` and `Select` components via `classNames` prop.
