### Task: Sync Account Selection and Style Tables in File Upload Components

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/preview-page.tsx` to manage account selection state for `FileUploadPage` and `FileUpload2Page`. This prevents the same account from being selected in both components. `preview-page.tsx` now fetches all accounts and passes filtered lists, the selected account, and an update handler to each child component. It also passes an `isLoading` prop.
  - Refactored `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` and `src/pages/file-upload-2.tsx`:
    - Updated to accept `accounts`, `selectedAccount`, `onAccountChange`, `componentId`, and `isLoading` as props.
    - Removed their internal logic for fetching accounts and managing `selectedAccount` state.
    - The `useEffect` hook that resets component state on `selectedMerchant` change was updated to call the `onAccountChange` prop.
    - The `rowsPerPage` constant was changed from `10` to `5`.
    - The `Card` components wrapping the "Processing Entries" and "Processed Entries" tables were given a `min-h-[350px]` class to ensure a consistent minimum height.
    - The `Select` component for account selection and the table `data-testid` attributes were updated to include the `componentId` prop for better testability.
    - The local `loading` state (and `setLoading` setter) was preserved in both components for handling the file upload process, distinct from the `isLoading` prop received from the parent.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/preview-page.tsx`
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`
  - `src/pages/file-upload-2.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-29-preview-page-sync-and-style-plan.md` (created)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Multiple `replace_in_file` attempts were needed for `file-upload.tsx` and `file-upload-2.tsx` due to the complexity of changes and ensuring the correct state of the file was used as a base for diffs.
  - Initial TypeScript errors in `preview-page.tsx` due to missing `useMemo` import were resolved.
  - TypeScript errors in `file-upload.tsx` and `file-upload-2.tsx` related to prop types and state management were resolved iteratively.

### Task: Refactor UI/UX for Account Selection on `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Addressed user feedback regarding the layout of the account selection section on the `file-upload.tsx` page.
  - The `motion.div` wrapping the "Select Account" dropdown and "Upload File & Set Mode" button was modified:
    - Removed the `w-full max-w-md mx-auto` classes that caused over-centering.
    - Applied `flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-end md:justify-between gap-4 mb-8` for a responsive layout. On medium screens and up, the select dropdown and upload button will be side-by-side.
    - The entire section is now styled with `p-4 sm:p-6 rounded-xl border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 shadow-lg bg-white dark:bg-gray-800/50` to give it a card-like, integrated appearance.
  - The `Select` component for account selection was given `className="w-full md:max-w-xs"` to control its width better on larger screens.
  - The "Upload File & Set Mode" `Button` was given `className="w-full md:w-auto"` to be full-width on small screens and auto-width on larger screens.
  - Ensured the `Tabs` component has `className="mt-6 w-full"` to utilize available width.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-29-file-upload-tabs-plan.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**: None.

### Task: Correct Status Color Syntax in `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Addressed user feedback regarding incorrect status colors in the tables on the `file-upload.tsx` page.
  - Corrected the template literal syntax in `className` definitions for status badges from `\${...}` to `${...}`. This ensures the dynamic class names for colors are applied correctly.
  - This fix was applied to:
    - Status display in the "Processing Entries" table.
    - Entry Status display in the "Processed Entries" table.
    - Recon Status display in the "Processed Entries" table.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-29-file-upload-tabs-plan.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**: None.

### Task: Refine Tabbed View in `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` (API and Polling Fixes)

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Addressed user feedback regarding 404 errors and polling behavior on the `file-upload.tsx` page.
  - **API Endpoint Correction**: Changed incorrect template literal syntax `\${selectedAccount}` to the correct `${selectedAccount}` in all API calls within `file-upload.tsx` (for fetching staging entries, account entries, and actual file upload).
  - **Conditional Polling**:
    - Modified the `useEffect` hooks responsible for fetching staging entries and account entries.
    - Polling for staging entries now only starts if `activeTabKey === "processing"`.
    - Polling for account entries now only starts if `activeTabKey === "processed"`.
    - `activeTabKey` was added to the dependency array of both `useEffect` hooks.
    - `intervalId` in these hooks is now initialized to `undefined` to prevent "used before assigned" TypeScript errors.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-29-file-upload-tabs-plan.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - TypeScript errors "Variable 'intervalId' is used before being assigned" were resolved by initializing `intervalId` to `undefined`.

### Task: Implement Tabbed View in `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` to display "Processing Entries" and "Processed Entries" tables within a tabbed interface.
  - Imported `Tabs` and `Tab` components from `@heroui/tabs`.
  - Added `activeTabKey` state to manage the currently selected tab.
  - Restructured the JSX:
    - Wrapped the two main table sections in a `Tabs` component.
    - Each section (Processing Entries, Processed Entries) is now a child of a `Tab` component, with `key` and `title` props.
    - Content for each tab (header, filters, Card with Table) is nested directly within its `Tab` component.
    - Added `className="mt-6"` to the `Tabs` component and `className="mt-4"` to internal content wrappers and `Card`s for spacing.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-29-file-upload-tabs-plan.md` (created and updated)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Initial import for `@heroui/tabs` was incorrect (tried `TabList`, `TabPanel` etc., which are not separate exports). Corrected based on user-provided example.
  - A brief attempt to import from `@heroui/react` also failed, confirming `@heroui/tabs` is the correct source for `Tabs` and `Tab`.

### Task: Refactor `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` Layout and UI (with Feedback)

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` to align its layout with `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`.
  - Changed the root wrapper to a `div` with class `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-8 sm:py-12`.
  - Updated the title section to a centered style.
  - Removed the `Card` component that previously wrapped the "Select Account" dropdown. The dropdown and its label are now directly within a styled `div` (with padding, border, shadow, and background) for visual separation and centering.
  - Added an "Upload File & Set Mode" button below the Account Selection section, which triggers a modal.
  - Implemented a `Modal` to house the `FileUploadForm`.
  - Modified `src/components/file-upload-form.tsx` to remove its internal `Card` and `motion.div` wrappers, so it only renders the form fields and status display directly. This ensures it appears cleanly within the `ModalBody` of `file-upload.tsx` as per feedback.
  - Removed the old, direct placement of `FileUploadForm` from `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`.
  - Ensured table sections are centered within the new single-column layout.
  - Added `isFileUploadModalOpen` state and updated `handleActualFileUpload` for modal interaction.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` (iterative changes based on plan and feedback)
  - `src/components/file-upload-form.tsx` (updated based on feedback)
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-29-file-upload-refactor-plan.md` (created and followed)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry updated)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Multiple `replace_in_file` attempts failed for inserting the Modal and removing the old form due to complexities in matching exact SEARCH blocks after previous `write_to_file` operations. Fallback to `write_to_file` was used to ensure progress for these steps.
  - Further `write_to_file` was used to incorporate user feedback regarding the Account Selection card removal and `FileUploadForm` internal structure.

### Task: Refactor `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` Layout

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` to align its layout and UI patterns with `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`.
  - Changed the root wrapper to a `div` with class `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-8 sm:py-12`.
  - Replaced the previous hero section with a simpler centered title, animated with `fadeInUp`.
  - Removed the two-column grid layout.
  - Consolidated the "Current Mappings" table into a single main `Card` component, animated with `scaleIn`.
  - The `CardBody` now includes a header with the "Current Mappings" title and a "New Mapping" button (with `PlusIcon`).
  - Moved the "Add Mapping" form into a `Modal` component, triggered by the "New Mapping" button.
  - Added `isCreateMappingModalOpen` state to manage the modal's visibility.
  - Updated `handleAddMapping` to close the modal upon successful mapping creation.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-28-rules-mapping-layout-refactor-plan.md` (followed)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Minor TypeScript error due to a leftover `</motion.section>` tag, which was removed.
  - TypeScript errors due to incorrect `value` prop on `SelectItem` in the new modal, which were corrected by removing the prop.

### Task: Refactor `account-creation.tsx` to Use Table Display

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` to replace the card-based list of accounts with a table display using `@heroui/table` components.
  - Imported `Table`, `TableHeader`, `TableColumn`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, `TableCell` from `@heroui/table`.
  - Implemented the table structure with columns for Account Name, Type, Currency, Balance, and Actions.
  - Integrated existing Edit and Delete buttons (with `Tooltip`s) into the "Actions" column.
  - Adapted loading and empty state messages for the new table layout.
  - Removed card-specific `fadeInUp` animations.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-28-account-table-refactor-plan.md` (created and updated)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**: None.

### Task: Refactor Merchant Selection & `MerchantManagementPage` UI for /process-flow

- **Status**: Partially Completed (Core UI refactored to shadcn-like design using HeroUI; action menu per merchant item is temporarily disabled pending clarification on `@heroui/menu` API).
- **Summary**:
  - Removed the global merchant selector from the Navbar for the `/process-flow` page.
  - Iteratively redesigned `MerchantManagementPage` (`src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`) based on user feedback aiming for a `shadcn/ui` look and feel, but implemented using existing `@heroui/*` components.
  - The page now features a modal for creating new merchants (triggered by a button) and allows selection of merchants from a list of card-like items.
  - Integrated with `DefaultContext` for state management (fetching merchants, adding, selecting).
  - The Edit/Delete actions menu for each merchant item has been temporarily commented out in the code to resolve TypeScript errors related to the `@heroui/menu` API. Further clarification is needed for its correct implementation.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/navbar.tsx`
  - `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx` (multiple iterations, significant rewrite)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry updated)
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (to be updated)
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-28-merchant-select-refactor-plan.md`
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Initial `replace_in_file` attempts for `merchant-creation.tsx` were challenging due to the complexity of UI changes.
  - Switched to `write_to_file` for `merchant-creation.tsx`. Early `write_to_file` attempts had issues (e.g., accidental CDATA wrapper, TypeScript errors due to API assumptions for `@heroui/menu` and context function signatures).
  - Iteratively resolved TypeScript errors. The current version of `merchant-creation.tsx` is functional but with the action menu temporarily disabled.

### Task: Implement Dynamic Color Theming and Apply to Components

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Implemented a dynamic color theming system allowing users to select a primary color scheme (blue, red, pink, etc.) from a navbar dropdown.
  - Created `src/config/colorThemes.ts` to define theme palettes (primary, focus, content colors).
  - Added CSS custom properties (e.g., `--color-primary-rgb`) to `src/styles/globals.css`, using space-separated RGB values for Tailwind compatibility.
  - Updated `tailwind.config.js` to use these CSS variables for its `primary`, `primary-focus`, and `primary-content` color definitions, and also configured the default `ringColor` to use the theme's primary color.
  - Created `src/contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` with a provider to manage the active theme, apply it by setting CSS variables on the root element, and persist the choice to localStorage. The `hexToRgb` utility was updated to output space-separated values.
  - Developed `src/components/ColorThemeSelector.tsx`, a dropdown component using HeroUI `Select` for theme selection.
  - Integrated `ColorThemeSelector` into `src/components/navbar.tsx`.
  - Wrapped the main application in `src/App.tsx` with `ColorThemeProvider`.
  - Refactored `src/components/row-steps.tsx` to remove its internal color prop logic and instead use the new theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes (`text-primary`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary-content`).
  - Updated the `title` primitive in `src/components/primitives.ts` to add a `primary` color variant (using `text-primary`) and ensured it doesn't conflict with gradient styles.
  - Updated page titles in `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`, and `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` to use `title({ color: "primary" })` so they reflect the selected theme.
  - Applied themed focus ring styles to `Input` and `Select` components across `merchant-creation.tsx`, `account-creation.tsx`, `rules-mapping.tsx`, `file-upload.tsx`, and `file-upload-form.tsx` using the `classNames` prop.
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `src/config/colorThemes.ts` (created)
  - `src/styles/globals.css` (updated)
  - `tailwind.config.js` (updated with ringColor)
  - `src/contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` (created, updated)
  - `src/components/ColorThemeSelector.tsx` (created, updated)

  - `src/components/primitives.ts` (updated)
  - `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx` (updated for title and input focus)
  - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` (updated for title and input/select focus)
  - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` (updated for title and select focus)
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` (updated for title and select focus)
  - `src/components/file-upload-form.tsx` (updated for select focus)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (to be updated)
  - `memory-bank/techContext.md` (to be updated)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Initial import errors for `colorThemes.ts` due to incorrect path assumptions and possibly TS server caching. Resolved by ensuring file creation and using correct alias.
  - `SelectItem` prop issue in `ColorThemeSelector` (removed `value` prop).
  - Buttons appeared transparent after Tailwind config update; resolved by changing CSS variable values and `hexToRgb` output to space-separated RGB values.
  - `title` primitive in `merchant-creation.tsx` (and other pages) caused a TS error when `color: "primary"` was used; resolved by updating the `title` primitive definition in `primitives.ts`.
  - Input focus rings remained blue; initially attempted to fix with `tailwind.config.js` `ringColor` default, then further addressed by applying specific `focus-within:ring-primary` and `focus:ring-primary` classes to `Input` and `Select` components via `classNames` prop.
