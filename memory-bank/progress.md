### Task: Refactor TypeScript Types
- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
    - Identified all inline TypeScript type and interface definitions in `src/pages` and `src/components`.
    - Created new domain-specific type definition files under `src/types/`:
        - `common.types.ts`
        - `merchant.types.ts`
        - `account.types.ts`
        - `rule.types.ts`
        - `file.types.ts`
    - Populated these files with the identified types, ensuring consistency (e.g., `UploadResponse` type usage).
    - Updated `src/types/index.ts` to act as a barrel file, re-exporting all types from the new domain-specific files.
    - Refactored all relevant `.tsx` files in `src/pages` and `src/components` to remove inline type definitions and import them from `@/types` via the barrel file.
    - Corrected type definitions in `common.types.ts` for `ThemeSwitchProps`, `NavigationButtonsProps`, and `RowStepsProps` to match actual component usage after initial refactoring attempts highlighted discrepancies.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `src/types/common.types.ts` (created and updated)
    - `src/types/merchant.types.ts` (created)
    - `src/types/account.types.ts` (created)
    - `src/types/rule.types.ts` (created)
    - `src/types/file.types.ts` (created)
    - `src/types/index.ts` (updated)
    - `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` (refactored, type usage corrected)
    - `src/components/theme-switch.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/components/NavigationButtons.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/components/RowSteps.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/components/merchant-select.tsx` (refactored)
    - `src/components/FileUploadForm.tsx` (refactored, type usage corrected)
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (updated)
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
    - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
    - Initial `replace_in_file` attempts for `src/components/theme-switch.tsx` and `src/components/RowSteps.tsx` failed due to outdated SEARCH blocks. Re-reading the files and adjusting the SEARCH blocks resolved this.
    - Discrepancies were found between the initially defined props in `common.types.ts` for `ThemeSwitchProps`, `NavigationButtonsProps`, and `RowStepsProps` versus their actual usage in the components. These were corrected in `common.types.ts`.
    - Type mismatch for `UploadResponse` and its usage in `uploadStatus` state in `file-upload.tsx` and `FileUploadForm.tsx` was identified and corrected.

### Task: Comprehensive Memory Bank Update
- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
    - Conducted a full review of all files in `src/pages/`.
    - Created or updated page-specific Memory Bank documents for:
        - `account-creation.tsx` (reviewed, re-saved)
        - `file-upload.tsx` (significantly updated)
        - `home.tsx` (newly created)
        - `index.tsx` (newly created as `index-page-component.md`, identified as a component)
        - `MainProcessFlowPage.tsx` (newly created)
        - `merchant-creation.tsx` (newly created)
        - `rules-mapping.tsx` (reviewed, re-saved)
    - Updated global Memory Bank files:
        - `systemPatterns.md`: Added new patterns (Two-Column CRUD, Complex Filtering, Wizard/Stepper, Page Composition, Polling) and refined API interaction details.
        - `productContext.md`: Added specific examples to reinforce UX expectations.
    - `techContext.md` was reviewed, but no changes were deemed necessary for this task.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `memory-bank/account-creation.md`
    - `memory-bank/file-upload.md`
    - `memory-bank/home.md`
    - `memory-bank/index-page-component.md`
    - `memory-bank/MainProcessFlowPage.md`
    - `memory-bank/merchant-creation.md`
    - `memory-bank/rules-mapping.md`
    - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
    - `memory-bank/productContext.md`
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated with task completion details)
    - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
    - Some page-specific Memory Bank files were missing and had to be created.
    - `memory-bank/file-upload.md` was significantly outdated.
    - `src/pages/index.tsx` was identified as a component/section, not a standalone page, requiring a differently named MB doc (`index-page-component.md`).

### Task: Add filter for non-archived transactions in the processed entries
- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
    - Successfully added a new filter to the "Processed Entries" table in `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`.
    - The filter is a `Switch` component labeled "Exclude Archived" which defaults to ON (hiding archived transactions).
    - Implemented logic to allow the "Recon Status" dropdown to override the switch if "ARCHIVED" is explicitly selected.
    - Added a new state variable `excludeArchivedTransactions` and updated relevant hooks.
    - Resolved an import error for the `Switch` component.
    - User confirmed the functionality is working as expected.
- **Files Modified**:
    - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`
    - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-22-plan.md` (all steps completed)
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated with task completion details)
- **Issues Encountered**:
    - Initial `EROFS: read-only file system` error when trying to write to `/memory-bank/` (resolved by using relative path `memory-bank/`).
    - TypeScript error for `Switch` import path (resolved by changing from `@heroui/react` to `@heroui/switch`).
