### Task: Refactor `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` Layout

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` to align its layout and UI patterns with `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`.
  - Changed the root wrapper to a `div` with class `max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 py-8 sm:py-12`.
  - Replaced the previous hero section with a simpler centered title, animated with `fadeInUp`.
  - Removed the two-column grid layout.
  - Consolidated the "Current Mappings" table into a single main `Card` component, animated with `scaleIn`.
  - The `CardBody` now includes a header with the "Current Mappings" title and a "New Mapping" button (with `PlusIcon`).
  - Moved the "Add Mapping" form into a `Modal` component, triggered by the "New Mapping" button.
  - Added `isCreateMappingModalOpen` state to manage the modal's visibility.
  - Updated `handleAddMapping` to close the modal upon successful mapping creation.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-28-rules-mapping-layout-refactor-plan.md` (followed)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Minor TypeScript error due to a leftover `</motion.section>` tag, which was removed.
  - TypeScript errors due to incorrect `value` prop on `SelectItem` in the new modal, which were corrected by removing the prop.

### Task: Refactor `account-creation.tsx` to Use Table Display

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Modified `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` to replace the card-based list of accounts with a table display using `@heroui/table` components.
  - Imported `Table`, `TableHeader`, `TableColumn`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, `TableCell` from `@heroui/table`.
  - Implemented the table structure with columns for Account Name, Type, Currency, Balance, and Actions.
  - Integrated existing Edit and Delete buttons (with `Tooltip`s) into the "Actions" column.
  - Adapted loading and empty state messages for the new table layout.
  - Removed card-specific `fadeInUp` animations.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-28-account-table-refactor-plan.md` (created and updated)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
- **Issues Encountered**: None.

### Task: Refactor Merchant Selection & `MerchantManagementPage` UI for /process-flow

- **Status**: Partially Completed (Core UI refactored to shadcn-like design using HeroUI; action menu per merchant item is temporarily disabled pending clarification on `@heroui/menu` API).
- **Summary**:
  - Removed the global merchant selector from the Navbar for the `/process-flow` page.
  - Iteratively redesigned `MerchantManagementPage` (`src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`) based on user feedback aiming for a `shadcn/ui` look and feel, but implemented using existing `@heroui/*` components.
  - The page now features a modal for creating new merchants (triggered by a button) and allows selection of merchants from a list of card-like items.
  - Integrated with `DefaultContext` for state management (fetching merchants, adding, selecting).
  - The Edit/Delete actions menu for each merchant item has been temporarily commented out in the code to resolve TypeScript errors related to the `@heroui/menu` API. Further clarification is needed for its correct implementation.
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/navbar.tsx`
  - `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx` (multiple iterations, significant rewrite)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry updated)
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (to be updated)
  - `memory-bank/plans/2025-05-28-merchant-select-refactor-plan.md`
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Initial `replace_in_file` attempts for `merchant-creation.tsx` were challenging due to the complexity of UI changes.
  - Switched to `write_to_file` for `merchant-creation.tsx`. Early `write_to_file` attempts had issues (e.g., accidental CDATA wrapper, TypeScript errors due to API assumptions for `@heroui/menu` and context function signatures).
  - Iteratively resolved TypeScript errors. The current version of `merchant-creation.tsx` is functional but with the action menu temporarily disabled.

### Task: Implement Dynamic Color Theming and Apply to Components

- **Status**: Completed
- **Summary**:
  - Implemented a dynamic color theming system allowing users to select a primary color scheme (blue, red, pink, etc.) from a navbar dropdown.
  - Created `src/config/colorThemes.ts` to define theme palettes (primary, focus, content colors).
  - Added CSS custom properties (e.g., `--color-primary-rgb`) to `src/styles/globals.css`, using space-separated RGB values for Tailwind compatibility.
  - Updated `tailwind.config.js` to use these CSS variables for its `primary`, `primary-focus`, and `primary-content` color definitions, and also configured the default `ringColor` to use the theme's primary color.
  - Created `src/contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` with a provider to manage the active theme, apply it by setting CSS variables on the root element, and persist the choice to localStorage. The `hexToRgb` utility was updated to output space-separated values.
  - Developed `src/components/ColorThemeSelector.tsx`, a dropdown component using HeroUI `Select` for theme selection.
  - Integrated `ColorThemeSelector` into `src/components/navbar.tsx`.
  - Wrapped the main application in `src/App.tsx` with `ColorThemeProvider`.
  - Refactored `src/components/row-steps.tsx` to remove its internal color prop logic and instead use the new theme-aware CSS variables and Tailwind classes (`text-primary`, `bg-primary`, `text-primary-content`).
  - Updated the `title` primitive in `src/components/primitives.ts` to add a `primary` color variant (using `text-primary`) and ensured it doesn't conflict with gradient styles.
  - Updated page titles in `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`, and `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` to use `title({ color: "primary" })` so they reflect the selected theme.
  - Applied themed focus ring styles to `Input` and `Select` components across `merchant-creation.tsx`, `account-creation.tsx`, `rules-mapping.tsx`, `file-upload.tsx`, and `file-upload-form.tsx` using the `classNames` prop.
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `src/config/colorThemes.ts` (created)
  - `src/styles/globals.css` (updated)
  - `tailwind.config.js` (updated with ringColor)
  - `src/contexts/ColorThemeContext.tsx` (created, updated)
  - `src/components/ColorThemeSelector.tsx` (created, updated)
  - `src/components/navbar.tsx` (updated)
  - `src/App.tsx` (updated)
  - `src/components/row-steps.tsx` (updated)
  - `src/components/primitives.ts` (updated)
  - `src/pages/merchant-creation.tsx` (updated for title and input focus)
  - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` (updated for title and input/select focus)
  - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` (updated for title and select focus)
  - `src/pages/file-upload.tsx` (updated for title and select focus)
  - `src/components/file-upload-form.tsx` (updated for select focus)
  - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (updated)
  - `memory-bank/progress.md` (this entry)
  - `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (to be updated)
  - `memory-bank/techContext.md` (to be updated)
- **Issues Encountered**:
  - Initial import errors for `colorThemes.ts` due to incorrect path assumptions and possibly TS server caching. Resolved by ensuring file creation and using correct alias.
  - `SelectItem` prop issue in `ColorThemeSelector` (removed `value` prop).
  - Buttons appeared transparent after Tailwind config update; resolved by changing CSS variable values and `hexToRgb` output to space-separated RGB values.
  - `title` primitive in `merchant-creation.tsx` (and other pages) caused a TS error when `color: "primary"` was used; resolved by updating the `title` primitive definition in `primitives.ts`.
  - Input focus rings remained blue; initially attempted to fix with `tailwind.config.js` `ringColor` default, then further addressed by applying specific `focus-within:ring-primary` and `focus:ring-primary` classes to `Input` and `Select` components via `classNames` prop.
