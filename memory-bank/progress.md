### Task: Standardize Table Cell Heights

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Ensured consistent table cell heights between `src/pages/account-creation.tsx` and `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx` using `py-0.5` padding.
- **Details:**
  - Applied a uniform vertical padding class (`py-0.5`) to all `TableCell` components in both files, based on user feedback (revised from `py-3`).
  - Standardized the size of action buttons and icons within the tables. Specifically, in `rules-mapping.tsx`, the delete `Button` was set to `size="sm"` and its `TrashIcon` was changed from `w-5 h-5` to `w-4 h-4` to match `account-creation.tsx`.
- **Impact:** Improves visual consistency and professionalism of the UI across different table views, adhering to the desired padding.
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`
  - `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`

### Task: Update Stepper Navigation Arrows

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Modified the `RowSteps.tsx` component to include built-in arrow navigation (left/right chevrons) with improved horizontal alignment and spacing. Removed the old "Previous" and "Next" buttons from `MainProcessFlowPage.tsx`.
- **Details:**
  - Added `ChevronLeftIcon` and `ChevronRightIcon` from `@heroicons/react/24/outline` to `RowSteps.tsx`.
  - Wrapped the step list in `RowSteps.tsx` with a flex container to include the new arrow buttons.
  - Implemented `handlePrevious` and `handleNext` logic within `RowSteps.tsx` to control `currentStep`.
  - Ensured arrow buttons are disabled appropriately at the beginning/end of the steps.
  - Used `@heroui/button` for consistent styling of the new arrow buttons.
  - Removed the old `handlePrevious`, `handleNext` functions and their corresponding `<button>` elements from `src/pages/MainProcessFlowPage.tsx`.
  - The `onStepChange` prop in `RowSteps` continues to correctly update the `currentStep` state in `MainProcessFlowPage.tsx`.
  - **Styling Adjustment:** Modified the `nav` element within `RowSteps.tsx` by removing `max-w-fit` and adding `flex justify-center` to improve horizontal centering and spacing of the steps list relative to the navigation arrows.
- **Impact:** Improves component encapsulation by making `RowSteps` self-contained for navigation. Provides a more integrated and visually balanced user experience for step navigation.
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/components/RowSteps.tsx`
  - `src/pages/MainProcessFlowPage.tsx`

### Task: Update Home Page for Unified Process Flow

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Modified `src/pages/home.tsx` to remove individual step navigation and added a 'Get Started' button linking to `/process-flow`. The aim is to guide users to a single, comprehensive process flow page.
- **Details:**
  - Removed the `steps` array and associated card rendering logic.
  - Updated the subtitle text to describe the unified flow.
  - Added a new `Button` component (using `as={Link}` from `@heroui/link`) linking to `/process-flow`.
  - Verified that the button correctly navigates to the `/process-flow` route.
- **Issues Encountered:** Initial attempts to verify navigation via `browser_action` were inconclusive, but the user confirmed the functionality is working as expected.
- **Impact:** Streamlines user navigation by directing them to a central process flow instead of separate initial steps.

### Task: Standardize Pagination

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Refactored pagination across `src/pages/account-creation.tsx`, `src/pages/file-upload.tsx`, and `src/pages/rules-mapping.tsx`. Replaced custom pagination button logic with the standardized `Pagination` component from `@heroui/pagination`.
- **Details:**
  - Added `import { Pagination } from "@heroui/pagination";` to relevant files.
  - Updated the `bottomContent` prop of the `Table` component to use `<Pagination total={pages} initialPage={page} onChange={setPage} />`.
  - Ensured pagination is only rendered if `pages > 1`.
- **Issues Encountered:**
  - Initial incorrect import path (`@heroui/react` instead of `@heroui/pagination`) was identified and corrected by the user.
  - Initial attempts to write to `/memory-bank/` (absolute root) failed due to file system permissions. Clarified with the user to use the project-relative `memory-bank/` directory.
- **Impact:** Improved code consistency, maintainability, and adherence to the HeroUI component library for pagination.

### Task: Update Memory Bank (Initial Setup)

- **Status:** Completed
- **Summary:** Created and populated all core Memory Bank documents based on the current understanding of the project and recent activities.
- **Files Updated/Created:**
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`
  - `activeContext.md`
  - `progress.md` (this file)
- **Details:** Content was generated by analyzing the project structure, existing Memory Bank snippets provided by the user, and the latest code changes.
- **Next Steps:** The Memory Bank is now up-to-date. Awaiting further tasks.
